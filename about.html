			<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
			<p class="content">Constantly seeking knowledge that can help better a cause, improve situations, intrigue curious minds, capture imaginations and advocate for those in need. Feel more centered when surrounded by nature and animals. My top strengths include empathetic, futuristic, relator, deliberative, and ideation. My background as a journalist enables me to see the world through different lenses while being inquisitive. Marketing, public relations, and SEO are at the forefront of any project - big or small. My experience in education and working with people with special needs has taught me the importance of accessibility and responsive design principles with regard to the multiple ways people interact with technology. I want to make an impact on my community and the world in which we live in. Whether it's improving upon the existing design of a website, adding accessibility options to apps, creating engaging educational tools to improve student learning, or helping a non-profit increase their reach and revenue. </p>
